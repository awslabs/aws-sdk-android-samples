# Android PubSub Sample

This sample demonstrates the use of the AWS IoT APIs to securely publish-to and subscribe-from MQTT topics.  It uses Cognito federated identities in conjunction with AWS IoT to create a client certificate and private key and store it in a local Java keystore.  This identity is then used to authenticate to AWS IoT.  Once a connection to the AWS IoT platform has been established, the sample app presents a simple UI to publish and subscribe over MQTT. The app will use the certificate and private key saved in the local java keystore for future connections.

## Requirements

* AndroidStudio 
* Android API 10 or greater

## Using the Sample

1. Import the AndroidPubSub project into Android Studio.
      * From the Welcome screen, click on "Import project".
      * Browse to the AndroidPubSub directory and press OK.
      * Accept the messages about adding Gradle to the project.
      * If the SDK reports some missing Android SDK packages (like Build Tools or the Android API package), follow the instructions to install them.
      
1. Import the libraries :
   -  Gradle will take care of downloading these dependencies automatically for you.

1. This sample will create a certificate and key, save it in the local java key store and upload the certificate to the AWS IoT platform.  To upload the certificate, it requires a Cognito Identity with access to AWS IoT to upload the device certificate. Use Amazon Cognito to create a new identity pool ( or you can reuse an identity pool that you previously created):
	*  In the [Amazon Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/), press the `Manage Identity Pools` button and on the resulting page press the `Create new identity pool` button.
	*  Give your identity pool a name and ensure that `Enable access to unauthenticated identities` under the `Unauthenticated identities` section is checked.  This allows the sample application to assume the unauthenticated role associated with this identity pool.  Press the `Create Pool` button to create your identity pool.

		**Important**: see note below on unauthenticated user access.

		* As part of creating the identity pool, Cognito will setup two roles in [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles).  These will be named something similar to: `Cognito_<<PoolName>>Auth_Role` and `Cognito_<<PoolName>>Unauth_Role`.  You can view them by pressing the `View Details` button on the console.  Now press the `Allow` button to create the roles.
	* Note the `Identity pool ID` value that shows up in red in the "Getting started with Amazon Cognito" page. It should look similar to: `us-east-1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx". Also, note the region that is being used.  These will be used in the application code later.
    *  Next,  we will attach a policy to the unauthenticated role to setup permissions to access the required AWS IoT APIs.  This is done by first creating the IAM Policy shown below in the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles) and then attaching it to the unauthenticated role.  In the IAM console, Search for the pool name that you created  and click on the link for the unauth role.  Click on the "Add inline policy" button and add the following policy using the JSON tab. Click on "Review Policy", give the policy a descriptive name and then click on "Create Policy".  This policy allows the sample app to create a new certificate (including private key) and attach a policy to the certificate.

        ```
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "iot:AttachPrincipalPolicy",
                "iot:CreateKeysAndCertificate"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                "*"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        **Note**: to keep this example simple it makes use of unauthenticated users in the identity pool.  This can be used for getting started and prototypes but unauthenticated users should typically only be given read-only permissions if used in production applications.  More information on Cognito identity pools can be found [here](http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), information on AWS IAM roles and policies can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html), and information on AWS IoT policies can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/authorization.html).

1. The configuration we have setup up to this point will enable the Sample App to connect to the AWS IoT platform using Cognito and upload certificates and policies.  Next, we will need to create a policy, that we will attach to the Device Certificate that will authorize the certificate to connect to the AWS IoT message broker and perform publish, subscribe and receive operations. To create the policy in AWS IoT,
    *  Navigate to the [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home) and press the `Get Started` button.  On the resulting page click on `Secure` on the side panel and the click on `Policies`.
    * Click on `Create`
    * Give the policy a name.  Note this name as you will use it in the application when making the attach policy API call.
    * Click on `Advanced Mode` and replace the default policy with the following text and then click the `Create` button.

        ```
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "iot:Connect",
              "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                "iot:Publish",
                "iot:Subscribe",
                "iot:Receive"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    	**Note**: To keep things simple, This policy allows access to all the topics under your AWS IoT account. This can be used for getting started and prototypes. In product, you should scope this policy down to specific topics, specify them explicitly as ARNs in the resource section: `"Resource": "arn:aws:iot:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT ID>:topic/<<mytopic/mysubtopic>>"`.

1. Open the AndroidPubSub project.

1. Open `PubSubActivity.java` and update the following constants:

    ```
    CUSTOMER_SPECIFIC_ENDPOINT = "<CHANGE_ME>";
    ```
    The customer specific endpoint can be found on the IoT console settings page. Navigate to the [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home) and press the `Settings` button.

    ```
    COGNITO_POOL_ID = "<CHANGE_ME>";
    MY_REGION = Regions.US_EAST_1;
    ```
    This would be the name of the Cognito pool ID and the Region that you noted down previously. 

    ```
    AWS_IOT_POLICY_NAME = "CHANGE_ME";
    ```
    This would be the name of the AWS IoT policy that you created previously. 

    ```
    KEYSTORE_NAME = "iot_keystore";
    KEYSTORE_PASSWORD = "password";
    CERTIFICATE_ID = "default";
    ```
    For these parameters, the default values will work for the sample application.  The keystore name is the name used when writing the keystore file to the application's file directory.  The password is the password given to protect the keystore when written.  Certificate ID is the alias in the keystore for the certificate and private key entry.  

   **Note**: If you end up creating a keystore off of the device you will need to update this to match the alias given when importing the certificate into the keystore.

1. Build and run the sample app.

1. The sample application will allow you to connect to the AWS IoT platform, and then publish or subscribe to a topic using MQTT.

   **Note**: This application also contains commented-out code for accessing a KeyStore that was deployed as a resource file as part of an APK.


### Using an off-device keystore (optional)

This section provides information about how to use an AWS IoT certificate and private key which were created off of the device.  The following instructions walk through the process of creating a keystore which can be placed on the filesystem of the device and accessed by the Android SDK.

The keytool command does not allow importing an existing private key into a keystore.  To work around this, we first create a PKCS12 formatted keystore with the certificate and private key and then we convert it to a Java keystore using keytool.

#### Prerequisites

* OpenSSL
* Java Keytool Utility (available in the JDK, see [Keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html))
* BouncyCastle Provider Library (see [BouncyCastle Releases](http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html))

#### Steps

1. Import certificate and private key into PKCS12 keystore.

        openssl pkcs12 -export -out <keystore name>.p12 -inkey <private key file>.pem -in <certificate file>.pem -name <alias name>
    
    The alias parameter defines the alias of the cert/key in the keystore.  This is used in the SDK to access the correct certificate and private key entry if the keystore contains more than one.  This command will prompt for a password.  This password will be the source password when converting to BKS in the following step.

1. Convert PKCS12 keystore to a BKS (BouncyCastle) keystore.

        keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <keystore name>.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore <keystore name>.bks -deststoretype bks --provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -â€“providerpath path/to/provider/jar/bcprov-jdk15on-146.jar

    This command will prompt for both a destination password and a source password.  The source password is the export password given in the previous step.  The destination password will be the password required to access the private key in the keystore going forward.  This password will be required inside your application when accessing the keystore.  You can test the password in the next step.

1. List aliases in keystore to verify (optional).

        keytool -list -v -keystore <keystore name>.bks -storetype bks -storepass <keystore password> -provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -providerpath path/to/provider/jar/bcprov-jdk15on-146.jar

1. Push to Android Emulator (optional).

        adb root
        adb push <keystore name>.bks /data/user/0/your_app_dir_goes_here/files/<keystore name>

    The directory and filename used will depend on your use case.  Typically the application's files directory is in /data/user/0/<app namespace>/files/.  You may however choose to locate your keystore on removable media or another space on the filesystem.  The SDK allows for specifying the file path and name of the keystore so the choice is up to you.
